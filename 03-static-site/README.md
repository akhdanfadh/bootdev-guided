# Static Site Generator in Python

Course website: https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python

## Architecture

Copy pasted from Ch1L7, the flow of data through the full system is:

1. Markdown files are in the /content directory. A template.html file is in the root of the project.
2. The static site generator (the Python code in src/) reads the Markdown files and the template file. Test files are located in tests/ directory.
3. The generator converts the Markdown files to a final HTML file for each page and writes them to the /public directory.
4. We start the built-in Python HTTP server (a separate program, unrelated to the generator) to serve the contents of the /public directory on http://localhost:8888 (our local machine).
5. We open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8888 to view the rendered site.
