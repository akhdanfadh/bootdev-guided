# Pokedex

Pokedex is a command-line [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) that lets us look up information about Pokemon - things like their name, type, and stats - using the incredible [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

As `main.go` is a symlink of `cmd/pokedex/main.go`, simply run/build the project by:

```bash
# Start REPL directly
go run .

# Build the binary
go build -o pokedex
./pokedex
```

Or to build the binary
